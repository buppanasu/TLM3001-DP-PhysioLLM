## Rehabilitation Protocol for Anterior Cruciate Ligament (ACL) Reconstruction

This protocol is intended to guide clinicians through the post-operative course for ACL Reconstruction. This protocol is time based (dependent on tissue healing) as well as criterion based. Specific intervention should be based on the needs of the individual and should consider exam findings and clinical decision making. The timeframes for expected outcomes contained within this guideline may vary based on surgeon's preference, additional procedures performed, and/or complications. If a clinician requires assistance in the progression of a post-operative patient, they should consult with the referring surgeon.

The interventions included within this protocol are not intended to be an inclusive list of exercises. Therapeutic interventions should be included and modified based on the progress of the patient and under the discretion of the clinician.

## Considerations for allograft and hamstring autograft

Early weight bearing and early rehabilitation intervention vary for allograft and hamstring autograft. Please reference specific instructions below. Expectations are the early return to sport phase will be delayed.

## Considerations with concomitant injuries

Be sure to follow the more conservative protocol with regards to range of motion, weight bearing, and rehab progression when there are concomitant injuries (i . e . meniscus repair) .

## Post -operative considerations

If you develop a fever, intense calf pain, excessive drainage from the incision, uncontrolled pain or any other symptoms you have concerns about you should call your doctor.

## Return to Running Program

This program is designed as a guide for clinicians and patients through a progressive return-to-run program. Patients should demonstrate > 80% on the Functional Assessment prior to initiating this program (after a knee ligament or meniscus repair). Specific recommendations should be based on the needs of the individual and should consider clinical decision making. If you have questions, contact the referring physician.

## Recommendations

- · Runs should occur on softer surfaces during Phase I
- · Non -impact activity on off days
- · Goal is to increase mileage and then increase pace; avoid increasing two variables at once
- · 10% rule: no more than 10% increase in mileage per week

## Agility and Plyometric Program

This program is designed as a guide for clinicians and patients through a progressive series of agility and plyometric exercises to promote successful return to sport and reduce injury risk. Patients should demonstrate > 80% on the Functional Assessment prior to initiating this program. Specific intervention should be based on the needs of the individual and should consider clinical decision making. If you have questions, contact the referring physician.

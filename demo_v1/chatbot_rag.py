    Context: The user is learning about musculoskeletal and physiotherapy issues.

    Your role is to help out by providing a treatmwent plan that caters towards the patient's specific condition
    
    Use only the knowledge and context supplied below here, as context:
    {context}

    Question: {question}

    Provide a treatment plan for the user.

    Example 1 of a treatment plan:

    Early Stage (Weeks 0-6): Passive Motion Exercises
    For ages 20-60; exercises focus on flexibility and preventing stiffness without stressing the rotator cuff.

    Pendulum Swings

    How: Lean forward, support yourself with your non-injured arm on a chair, and let the affected arm hang down.
    Movement: Gently swing the arm in small circles (10 in each direction).
    Sets/Reps: 1 set, 10-15 seconds per direction.
    Frequency: 3 times daily.
    Assisted Shoulder Flexion (Using a Wand or Stick)

    How: Lie on your back, hold a stick with both hands, and gently lift it over your head.
    Movement: Use your non-injured arm to guide your injured arm in lifting overhead.
    Sets/Reps: 3 sets of 10 reps.
    Frequency: Once daily.
    Passive External Rotation with Wand

    How: Sit or stand holding a stick horizontally in front of you, with elbows at a 90Â° angle.
    Movement: Gently push with your non-injured arm to rotate the injured arm outward.
    Sets/Reps: 3 sets of 10 reps.
    Frequency: Once daily.

    Mid-Stage (Weeks 6-12): Active Assisted Motion & Light Strengthening
    For ages 20-60; progress toward active motion and light resistance.

    Active Assisted Shoulder Abduction (Using Wall Support)

    How: Stand next to a wall, and use your fingers to walk up the wall sideways until reaching shoulder height.
    Sets/Reps: 3 sets of 10 reps.
    Frequency: 3 times weekly.
    Scapular Retractions

    How: Sit or stand with your arms by your side.
    Movement: Pinch shoulder blades together gently, holding for 5 seconds.
    Sets/Reps: 3 sets of 10 reps.
    Frequency: 3 times weekly.
    External Rotation with Resistance Band

    How: Anchor a resistance band at elbow height, and hold the other end with your injured arm, keeping your elbow close to your body.
    Movement: Rotate your forearm outward against the band.
    Sets/Reps: 2-3 sets of 8-10 reps.
    Frequency: 2-3 times weekly.
    Internal Rotation with Resistance Band

    How: Anchor a resistance band at elbow height, and hold it with your injured arm, keeping your elbow close to your body.
    Movement: Rotate your forearm inward against the resistance band.
    Sets/Reps: 2-3 sets of 8-10 reps.
    Frequency: 2-3 times weekly.

    Age-Related Modifications
    Older Adults (60+): Start with lighter resistance, fewer reps (6-8 reps), and focus on form to prevent overloading.
    Younger Adults (20-40): Increase reps to 12-15 as strength builds and consider heavier weights as tolerated in later stages.

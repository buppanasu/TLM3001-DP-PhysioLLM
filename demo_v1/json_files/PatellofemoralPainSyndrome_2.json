    "Rehabilitation Protocol for Patellofemoral Pain Syndrome": {
        "Introduction": {
            "content": "This guideline is intended to provide the clinician with a guideline of the non-operative course of care for Patellofemoral Pain Syndrome. Specific intervention should be based on the needs of the individual and should consider exam findings and clinical decision making. The timeframes for expected outcomes contained within this guideline may vary. If a clinician requires assistance in the progression of a patient, they should consult with the referring provider. The interventions included within this protocol are not intended to be an inclusive list. Therapeutic interventions should be included and modified based on the progress of the patient and under the discretion of the clinician.",
            "terms": "Patellofemoral Pain Syndrome (PFPS) is a general category of anterior knee pain that is characterized as pain behind or around the patella, as a result of patella malalignment, altered patellofemoral (PF) joint forces and/or repetitive stress to the area. Also known as Runner's Knee, chondromalacia patella, retropatellar pain syndrome, anterior knee pain syndrome, patellar malalignment, and patellofemoral arthralgia. Patellofemoral syndrome can have a collection of signs and symptoms which may encompass body regions throughout the kinetic chain, from the lumbar spine to the feet."

                "pain": "Pain: typically reported anywhere circumferential to the anterior knee or retropatellar region.",
                "common_aggravating_factors": "Common Aggravating Factors: prolonged sitting, squatting, climbing/descending stairs, running, and jumping.",
                "increased_varum_valgum": "Increased tibiofemoral varum/valgum or tibial varum: normal subjects with hypermobility exhibit larger Q angles than normal subjects with normal mobility. Patients with greater amounts of medial rotation of the femur with respect to the tibia, typically produce larger amounts of contact area at the patellofemoral joint.",
                "foot_position": "Foot position/footwear. Excessive or late pronation during gait can increase tibial internal rotation, thus altering patellofemoral forces.",
                "higher_level_activities": "Higher-level activities which include landing with excessive hip internal rotation and/or knee valgus may contribute to abnormal PF joint loading."

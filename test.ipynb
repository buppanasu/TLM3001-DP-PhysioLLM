    "Convert the following structured text into JSON format. Follow these specific instructions to handle split sections, footnotes, and create a clean, structured JSON output:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Hierarchical Structure**: Treat each heading or subheading as a key, creating a nested dictionary for each level.\n",
    "   - Only the lowest level of headings should contain actual content.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Joining Split Content**: When a sentence or phrase is cut off due to page or line breaks:\n",
    "   - Detect incomplete sentences or phrases that end abruptly, especially if they end mid-sentence.\n",
    "   - Look at the start of the following section to determine if it completes the previous content, and merge them seamlessly.\n",
    "   - Ensure there are no duplicate words when merging (e.g., if merging \"conversation\" and \"conversation then,\" keep only one instance of \"conversation\").\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Footnotes Integration**: If a footnote is present (indicated by a superscript number following a term or phrase), insert the corresponding footnote text directly into the sentence in parentheses.\n",
    "   - For instance, if a phrase like \"cloud infrastructure2\" is followed by footnote 2 with additional details (\"2 Cloud Infrastructure: Refers to hardware and software resources...\"), embed the footnote text as \"(Refers to hardware and software resources...)\" immediately after \"cloud infrastructure\" in the sentence.\n",
    "   - Ensure the added footnote text blends naturally with the sentence structure, avoiding any disruption to readability.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Handling Explicit References**: If an item includes an explicit reference to another section or list (e.g., \"See Attendee List below\" or \"refer to the details provided later\"), replace the reference with the actual content from the specified section.\n",
    "   - Detect phrases like \"see below,\" \"refer to,\" \"see list,\" or other similar expressions that indicate a link to content elsewhere in the document.\n",
    "   - Embed the referenced content directly in place of the phrase, ensuring it is integrated seamlessly and contextually.\n",
    "   - Only form relationships when there is a clear and explicit reference, and avoid linking content that is not specifically indicated as a reference.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Content Accuracy**: Copy the content exactly as it appears without summarizing, rephrasing, or adding new words. The final JSON should contain verbatim text.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. **Final Validation**: After forming the JSON structure, perform a final check to confirm that:\n",
    "   - All sentences are complete and coherent, with no fragments or hanging phrases.\n",
    "   - Split sections and footnotes are correctly merged into a single, continuous text block where necessary.\n",

      "      \"content\": \"This guideline is intended to provide the clinician with a guideline of the non-operative course of care for Patellofemoral Pain Syndrome. Specific intervention should be based on the needs of the individual and should consider exam findings and clinical decision making. The timeframes for expected outcomes contained within this guideline may vary. If a clinician requires assistance in the progression of a patient, they should consult with the referring provider. The interventions included within this protocol are not intended to be an inclusive list. Therapeutic interventions should be included and modified based on the progress of the patient and under the discretion of the clinician. Patellofemoral Pain Syndrome (PFPS) is a general category of anterior knee pain that is characterized as pain behind or around the patella, as a result of patella malalignment, altered patellofemoral (PF) joint forces and/or repetitive stress to the area. Also known as Runner's Knee, chondromalacia patella, retropatellar pain syndrome, anterior knee pain syndrome, patellar malalignment, and patellofemoral arthralgia. Patellofemoral syndrome can have a collection of signs and symptoms which may encompass body regions throughout the kinetic chain, from the lumbar spine to the feet.\"\n",

    "    \"Introduction\": {\n",
    "      \"content\": \"This guideline is intended to provide the clinician with a guideline of the non-operative course of care for Patellofemoral Pain Syndrome. Specific intervention should be based on the needs of the individual and should consider exam findings and clinical decision making. The timeframes for expected outcomes contained within this guideline may vary. If a clinician requires assistance in the progression of a patient, they should consult with the referring provider. The interventions included within this protocol are not intended to be an inclusive list. Therapeutic interventions should be included and modified based on the progress of the patient and under the discretion of the clinician. Patellofemoral Pain Syndrome (PFPS) is a general category of anterior knee pain that is characterized as pain behind or around the patella, as a result of patella malalignment, altered patellofemoral (PF) joint forces and/or repetitive stress to the area. Also known as Runner's Knee, chondromalacia patella, retropatellar pain syndrome, anterior knee pain syndrome, patellar malalignment, and patellofemoral arthralgia. Patellofemoral syndrome can have a collection of signs and symptoms which may encompass body regions throughout the kinetic chain, from the lumbar spine to the feet.\"\n",

Patients with greater amounts of medial rotation of the femur with respect to the tibia, typically produce larger amounts of contact area at the patellofemoral joint.\",\n",
    "        \"Foot position/footwear. Excessive or late pronation during gait can increase tibial internal rotation, thus altering patellofemoral forces.\",\n",
